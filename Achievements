LOBE - AI MODEL
Lobe has made Machine learning easy
Lobe has everything you need to bring your machine learning ideas to life. 
Just show it examples of what you want it to learn, and it automatically trains a custom machine learning model that can be shipped in your app.
--> In this project I have collected samples of images of people wearing mask and not wearing mask. Once they are loaded in the app, 
the app trains itself as per the images. Hence whatever image of a person is given to the model as input, 
it recognizes whether the person is wearing any mask or not with good accuracy.
